# Dotfiles

My dotfiles repo with config files for various programs

I use [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for my dotfiles management

TL; DR;

 - Install GNU Stow
 - Clone the dotfiles to `$HOME/dotfiles`
 - `cd $HOME/dotfiles`
 - Run `stow` followed by the program name to install the dotfiles for the specific program  


 For example, running  `stow vim` will install the dotfiles for vim

Here is an [excellent tutorial](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html)
that gives more detailed instructions on using Stow for managing your dotfiles.
